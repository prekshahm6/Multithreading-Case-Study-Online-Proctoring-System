# Multithreading-Case-Study-Online-Proctoring-System
This project demonstrates a basic multithreaded online proctoring system using C. It simulates video recording, mouse movement monitoring, and tab switching detection as separate threads running concurrently. The project focuses on understanding thread creation and parallel execution using the pthread library in a simple, beginner-friendly way.
